## Summary
This is a website that is based on a previous project worked on by me and other collaborators. It has been revamped and given a better look for mobile view. It takes in a hero or villain input and displays comics for that character through the use of an api.

## Usage
You input a hero/villain name based in the marvel universe into the search bar and you must click search or enter for your hero/villain to be searched. You then are displayed with 10 comics for that character, for each displayed comic if you click on any it will display a modal with more information on the comic and the contributors of the comic.

### Working comic description
This shows that the comic description block does work with comics that have a description available.

## Challenges
The main challenge for this revamped project was figuring out a good layout that would look good on both desktop and mobile. Another challenge was figuring out a good color contrast in order to achieve accessiblity for a broader audience. A big issue was the spelling for some heros, based on the Api some of the characters names are there actual name and not their aliases so it sometimes does not recognize a character name unless its their birth name.
